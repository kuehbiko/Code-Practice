LeetCode SQL I (Using MySQL)

DAY 1 - 24 Sep 2022

595. Big Countries
A country is big if:
it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT name, population, area FROM world
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000

1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products
Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT product_id FROM products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'

584. Find Customer Referee
Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT name FROM customer
WHERE IFNULL(referee_id,0) <> 2;

Note: NULL entries cannot be queried with the usual operators >,<,=. use IFNULL/ISNULL (MySQL, MS SQL) to replace the null values before querying.

183. Customers Who Never Order
Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT name as customers FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customerid
WHERE orders.customerid IS NULL;

Note: Turns out you CAN have a column name be the same as a table name...

DAY 2 - 25 Sep 2022

1873. Calculate Special Bonus
Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

SELECT employee_id, IF(employee_id%2 = 1 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%', salary, 0) AS bonus 
FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id

627. Swap Salary

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

UPDATE salary
SET sex = IF(sex = 'f', 'm', 'f');

196. Delete Duplicate Emails

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one

DELETE person2
FROM person AS person1, person AS person2
WHERE person1.email = person2.email AND person2.id > person1.id;
