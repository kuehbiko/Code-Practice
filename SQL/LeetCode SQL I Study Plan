LeetCode SQL I (Using MySQL)

DAY 1 - 24 Sep 2022

595. Big Countries
A country is big if:
it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT name, population, area FROM world
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000

1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products
Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT product_id FROM products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'

584. Find Customer Referee
Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT name FROM customer
WHERE IFNULL(referee_id,0) <> 2;

Note: NULL entries cannot be queried with the usual operators >,<,=. use IFNULL/ISNULL (MySQL, MS SQL) to replace the null values before querying.

183. Customers Who Never Order
Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT name as customers FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customerid
WHERE orders.customerid IS NULL;

Note: Turns out you CAN have a column name be the same as a table name...
